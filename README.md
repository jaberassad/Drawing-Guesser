# QuickDraw Neural Network Training and Tkinter App 

## Overview 📝

This project involves training a neural network to recognize and classify drawings made by users. The neural network is trained using data from the QuickDraw dataset and is integrated into a Tkinter application that allows users to draw and receive real-time predictions of their drawings.

## Features 

- **Data** 📊: Trained a feedforward neural network using public data from QuickDraw datasets.
- **Neural Network** 🧠: Created a model using the TensorFlow library that achieves close to 90% accuracy.
- **Real-Time Predictions** ⚡: Displays the top 5 most likely categories and their probabilities as the user draws.
- **Tkinter Interface** 🖌️: User-friendly drawing application built with Tkinter for drawing and predicting.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites 📦
- TensorFlow
- Tkinter
- Pandas
- Numpy
- PIL
- Python 3.11 and up

### Installation 🔧

1. **Clone the Repository** 

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quickdraw-tkinter-app.git
   cd quickdraw-tkinter-app](https://github.com/jaberassad/Drawing-Guesser.git


2. **Run the tkinter app**

3. ```bash
   python3 app.py

### Neural Network Architecture

The neural network takes as input an array representing the user's drawing. Below is a summary of the architecture:
1. **Input Layer**:
   - Size: 784 units (flattened 28x28 pixel images)
   - **Normalization**: The input images are normalized to have values between 0 and 1.

2. **Dense Layer 1**:
   - Units: 300
   - Activation Function: ReLU

3. **Dense Layer 2**:
   - Units: 60
   - Activation Function: ReLU

4. **Dense Layer 3**:
   - Units: 50
   - Activation Function: ReLU

5. **Dense Layer 4**:
   - Units: 40
   - Activation Function: ReLU

6. **Output Layer** 🎯:
   - Units: Number of categories (equal to the number of classes in the dataset)
   - Activation Function: Softmax

### Model Training 📚

- **Optimizer**: Adam 
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Cross-Entropy
- **Metrics**: Accuracy
- **Epochs**: 10
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Validation Split**: 0.2

The model is trained on 80% of the data while the rest is used for evaluation to reduce bias and have an accurate estimate on its performance.
