# QuickDraw Neural Network Training and Tkinter App

## Overview

This project involves training a neural network to recognize and classify drawings made by users. The neural network is trained using data from the QuickDraw dataset and is integrated into a Tkinter application that allows users to draw and receive real-time predictions of their drawings.

## Features

- **Neural Network Training**: Trained using the QuickDraw dataset, which includes various drawing categories.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Displays the top 5 most likely categories and their probabilities as the user draws.
- **Tkinter Interface**: User-friendly drawing application built with Tkinter for drawing and predicting.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
